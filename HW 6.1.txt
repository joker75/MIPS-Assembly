# Homework 6.1
# Loops
# $t0 contains the hex number	#t1 holds the memory address
# $a0 holds the current hex value that'll be stored

# 1.1 The memory addresses of w, x, y and z: 0x10010000, 0x10010004, 0x10010008, 0x1001000c
# 1.2 By shifting the contents within register $t1, the upper most bits will be replaced by 0;
#  thus, the only condition to check for is when the contents are exactly 0.
